# Playwright Playground
## Module 6 - Thread Safety and Parallel Execution
This repo consists of examples regarding multi threading and parallel test execution of playwright tests with JUnit 5.

The examples are split into modules:
* [thread-safety](/thread-safety)
* [junit-sequential](/junit-sequential)
* [junit-parallel](/junit-parallel)
* [junit-parallel-fixtures](/junit-parallel-fixtures)
* [junit-parallel-custom-fixtures](/junit-parallel-custom-fixtures)

Every module has its own README file, explaining how to build the module and execute the Playwright tests.
